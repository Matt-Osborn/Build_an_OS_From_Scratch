Registers:
bx and bp (and ss and sp)

In x86 the registers bx and bp are totally unrelated. The only common thing about them is the word base.

    bx (base index) is a general-purpose register (like ax, cx and dx), typically used as a pointer to data (used for arrays and such)
    bp (base pointer) is typically used to point at some place in the stack (for instance holding the address of the current stack frames)

Again, ss and sp are different as well.

    ss (stack segment) is a segment register (like cs, ds and es). It holds the segment used by the stack.
    sp (stack pointer) points at the top of the stack
